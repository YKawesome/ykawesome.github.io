## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio site showcases who I am, what I’ve worked on, and what I enjoy building. It’s built with modern web technologies and aims to be both functional and expressive — fast, responsive, and smooth.

> From custom link previews to animated page transitions, this site is designed to feel more like a product than a portfolio.
